# TaxMate AI

TaxMate AI is an intelligent, user-friendly application designed to simplify the UK tax filing process. It provides users with personalized tax deduction suggestions and financial efficiency plans by leveraging the power of generative AI.

The app is built with a modern tech stack, including Next.js, React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase for authentication and backend services.

## Core Features

- **AI-Powered Deductions**: Utilizes Genkit and Google's Gemini models to analyze user data and suggest potential tax deductions and savings strategies.
- **Tax Efficiency Planning**: Offers personalized advice on savings and investments to help users reach their financial goals.
- **Secure Authentication**: Supports secure sign-in with Google and as a guest, powered by Firebase Authentication.
- **Privacy-Focused**: The application does not store any sensitive user financial data, processing it in-memory to provide AI-driven insights.

## How it uses RAG for Tax Computations

The application employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to deliver accurate and context-aware tax advice. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1.  **User Input**: The user provides their financial data through the application's form.
2.  **AI Flow Invocation**: This data is securely passed to a Genkit flow running on the server.
3.  **Dynamic Prompting & Retrieval**: Instead of just using a static prompt, the AI flow is designed to act as an agent. The user's financial data is used to augment a base prompt, which then queries a real-time knowledge source (like a Google Search over `gov.uk` tax documents) for the latest UK tax laws, allowances, and deduction criteria relevant to the user's specific situation.
4.  **Generation with Context**: The retrieved, up-to-date tax information is combined with the user's data and fed into the Gemini LLM. This provides the model with the necessary context to perform its reasoning.
5.  **Structured Output**: The LLM generates a structured JSON output containing personalized, actionable tax advice, which is then displayed to the user in a clear and understandable format.

By using RAG, TaxMate AI ensures that its suggestions are not based solely on the LLM's pre-existing knowledge but are grounded in the most current tax regulations, providing more reliable and relevant guidance.
